Trinamool Congress president and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the finance minister had offered nothing to states and her announcements were \"a big zero\".Outlining the first set of components of the Rs 20 lakh crore COVID-19 economic stimulus package, Ms Sitharaman announced about Rs 6 lakh crore in allocations, including Rs 3 lakh crore of collateral-free loans for small businesses and a Rs 30,000 crore lifeline to non-bank and housing finance companies as part of measures to help the economy tide over disruptions caused by the coronavirus lockdown.On Thursday, she announced a second batch of measures to help migrant workers, street vendors, small farmers."},

Revealing this, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said in its weekly report that the unemployment rate fell from 27.1 percent to 24 percent. For the week ended 10 May, labour participation rate rose from 36.2 percent to 37.6 percent as the centre as opened industries in a staggered manner and, employment rate from 26.4 percent to 28.6 percent.Data from CMIE\u2019s Consumer Pyramids Household Survey reveals youngsters in the age group 20-24 years accounted for 8.5 percent of the total employed persons in the country in 2019-20. But, they accounted for 11 percent of those who lost jobs. Around 34.2 million of these young men and women were working in 2019-20. In April 2020 their numbers were down to 20.9 million. Over 13 million youngsters lost their jobs in the lockdown.Another 14 million jobs were lost in the age-group 25-29 years, the CMIE report said. \"This loss again, was disproportionately high. This group accounted for 11.1 percent of total employment in 2019-20 but it accounted for 11.5 percent of the job losses,\" the report said.Over 27 million youngsters in their 20s lost their jobs in April. This has serious long-term repercussion, the report said, adding it is during this age that young India builds its career in the hope of a bright future. If the career of this cohort is disrupted or postponed by even a year it will have to compete with the new cohorts joining the labour force after them - arguably, for fewer jobs. Young India will not be able to build the savings it will require later in life, the report said.In April, 33 million men and women in their 30s lost jobs. Around 86 percent of the job losses were among men.The CMIE report said, job losses among the vulnerable are likely to raise the proportion of households in debt. It will also possibly raise debt delinquency. Job losses among the young population would have implications on savings. While households may well conserve cash during these times, the loss of jobs among the young deprives households of the extra cash that is mostly saved for either buying a house or durables or for retirement. This loss of savings will have long-term implications, the report said."},

Borussia Moenchengladbach\u2019s encounter with Cologne on 11 March was the only top-flight game ever to have been played without supporters.In other parts of Europe, however, such ghost games are not a rare occurrence, with most due to sanctions for crowd trouble.Yet German fans must now surrender an ingrained Saturday afternoon routine and watch the league restart from afar, knowing any attempt to get close to the team would be a violation of the league\u2019s health regulations.A total of around 300 players, officials and staff will be allowed in and around the stadiums during matches.Police will be keeping the areas around the arenas, including at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Signal Iduna Park ahead of the derby against fierce Ruhr valley rivals Schalke 04, off-limits for fans.\u201cEven though we have the desire to motivate the team as much as possible for the derby in front of empty tribunes with us being at the bus arrival, for example, we will not gather at the stadium,\u201d Borussia Dortmund fan group Suedtribuene said recently.Bundesliga clubs have been thinking of ways to enhance the atmosphere, either by playing music or putting up cardboard cutouts of fans in the seats, as is the case at Borussia Moenchengladbach.For 19 euros, the club offers to put a \u201ccardboard you\u201d in the stands - and visiting teams\u2019 fans can book cut-outs for the away end. The club said more than 12,000 such effigies have been ordered so far.However, fans say nothing can replace the real thing and more than 20 German supporter groups joined dozens of others across Europe to issue a call on behalf of \u2018United supporters of Europe\u2019 to football authorities to stop play until fans are allowed back in.\u201cSports clubs should fully understand the passion that holds thousands of people together, and not just listen to the wolves of business... the public and supporters are the essential factors of \u2018popular sport\u2019 by definition,\u201d the group said in a statement.\u201cTherefore, we strongly ask UEFA and the national associations to keep the ban and stop the football competitions until going to the stadiums is once again a habit free of risks for public health,\u201d they said."},

He obviously hadn't seen the plight of migrant workers today - walking mile after mile to get home, leaving the cities they came to in order to build a life of their own. But is the plight of a migrant worker any different in any era?Or for that matter the plight of the middle class? What does one do when the daughter, the sole bread-earner of the family doesn't come home? Where does it hurt the most - that the daughter is missing, or who is going to bring home the money?A genius like Mrinal Sen has always held a mirror up to the society, firmly. What you see in it shocks you, scares you, and makes you cringe. And then you realise that the teeth gnawing at you, the bloodshot eyes staring back at you from the mirror is yours, ours.  make up society.No, Mrinal Sen's art is not gory, it's not a Gangs Of Wasseypur. It's real, so real, that it hits you harder than all the bloodshed in GOW could. On the maverick's 97th birth anniversary today (May 14), we list some of his best.A villager migrates to the city hoping to find what he didn't find back home - the life of a human being. He carries an axe on his shoulder, symbolic of Parashuram. He finds shelter in a graveyard, finds a friend in a beggar, and finds comfort in the company of a woman - an equally troubled soul - who but briefly helps him escape the darkness in his head. But old scars never really fade; this is the story of descending into that darkness, even as the city lights up and bustles around.In a lower-middle-class community housing - a chawl - where everyone knows everyone and nothing much really happens on an everyday basis, a furore is raised. Chinu, the daughter, hasn't come home. She's the sole bread-earner of the family. In this, Sen questions patriarchy, yes, but also the inflated and often baseless moral values of the middle class. She has to go out and work, yet she has the burden of honour too.All Ranjit, a bright middle-class boy, has to do, is turn up for the job interview in a suit, and he's hired. Except due to a strange turn of events, he has to stick to traditional Bengali dhuti-panjabi. Do clothes really matter more than one's qualifications? Perhaps not, but can the jobless take that mighty stand?A tribal man, the best hunter, is accused of murdering a moneylender who kidnapped his wife and is sentenced to death. His death sparks a mutiny among the tribal people against both the British oppressors and the zamindars. Mrigaaya won Sen a National Award for Best Film, and Mithun Chakraborty, the lead, the Best Actor.Bhuvan Shome is a strict high-ranking railway officer in his 50s. He decides to go hunting, but fails, only to be rescued by Gouri, a woman from the village. As she teaches him to hunt, she also teaches him a new way of life, and Bhuvan, in turn, rises above his limitations. This story of personal growth tells you that as humans, we are ever-evolving. And we must not restrict it by what we know as the norm.Set in the 70s Kolkata when the Leftist movement was in full swing, Padatik follows the life of a young activist. Padatik is the story of change - the politics of Kolkata is changing, the middle class is changing, The film's screenplay is interspersed with newspaper headlines, and they make you realise that these could very well be of today's. Clearly somethings never change.Loosely translated as 'in search of a famine', Akaler Sandhane shows a film crew landing up in a village to make a film on the Bengal Famine of 1943, looking for stories. But do you really need to search for famine or devastation? It is around us all the time, everywhere. And, if Indian history taught us anything, it is that it always repeats itself. Many say the novel coronavirus pandemic will result in a Bengal Famine-like situation, only this time, it will be countrywide. Perhaps it's time to rewatch Akaler Sandhane.A professor goes missing, and his family looks for him. Through their search, the professor's character is sketched, as are that of his family members and close associates. He is neither found nor declared dead, but life for the rest must go on. Exactly a year after the fated day, in a scene, his wife and his two daughters are shown remembering him, and you realise that the family has grown closer than ever before. It is the story of human adaptability.A friendship blossoms between a housewife and a Chinese hawker. She reminds him of his sister back home. But this sublime relationship is misinterpreted both by the husband and society. Neel Akasher Neechey had a Communist leaning, showing how idealistically, everyone under the blue sky is after all equal. The film was also the first film banned in independent India for the political stand it took.Baishey Shravana is the 22nd day of the month of Shravan, the day Rabindranath Tagore died. Perhaps Sen used it as an allegory to talk about the degeneration of humanity. It showed the brutal aftermath of famine, a poor hawker losing his livelihood, and when thrust into poverty, it brings out the monster in him.()"},

It allows us to stay connected with our loved ones and even work from home seamlessly despite the lockdown. One of the biggest examples of technology helping in this time of crisis is the contact tracing  that uses Bluetooth and location data to alert users when they come in close contact with an infected person.A new tech has now arrived in town and it\u2019s from GOQii, a smart-tech-enabled integrated preventive healthcare platform. The company today announced a new technology in a wrist band that can detect whether you have fever or not.GOQii launched the world\u2019s first smart wrist band with sensors to detect body temperature, one of the early symptoms of  infection \u2014 Vital 3.0. The temperature range is 77\u00b0F to 113 \u00b0F with an accuracy of +/- 0.3 \u00b0F. Notably, GOQii Vital 3.0 is only a screening device and not a medical device and it is recommended that it be used for screening purposes only.Most smart bands available today can detect heart rate, steps, sleep and more but none can track the body temperature. With a minimalistic design, the newly announced GOQII Vital 3.0 \u2014 looks exactly like the GOQii Vital 2 smart band \u2014 can track body temperature though out the day. The band can also detect blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1 level. Users will be able to see the data on the GOQii app.Vishal Gondal Founder and CEO GOQII confirmed during a webinar that the band will soon able to detect ECG similar to  Watch. The option for ECG will come in the next few updates.Vital 3.0 is capable of recording body temperature with just a skin touch. Gondal said that currently, the wrist band will be available for enterprises and frontline workers mainly. He also confirmed that very few units of GOQii Vital 3.0 will be available for individuals. Interested consumers can purchase the band from the GOQii app at a price of Rs 3,999. It will be soon available on online platforms like Amazon and .

In order to ensure migrants be able to use their ration cards across states, the finance minister said PDS rations cards will be made portable, adding this would benefit 67 crore beneficiaries or 83 per cent of PDS beneficiaries, in 23 states by August. \u201cBy March 2021, 100 per cent coverage under \u2018One Nation One Ration Card\u2019 will be done,\u201d Sitharaman said in the media briefing.The government had last year launched the pilot project for the inter-state portability of ration cards between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and between Maharashtra and Gujarat, as part of its \u2018One Nation, One Ration Card\u2019 scheme. Since ration cards are issued by state governments, this implied that beneficiaries could procure food grains only from the designated ration shops within the concerned state. If a beneficiary were to shift to another state, he/she would need to apply for a new ration card in the second state. There were other complications. For instance, after marriage, a woman needed to get her name removed from the ration card issued to her parents, and get it added to the ration card issued to her husband\u2019s family.The ONORC scheme attempts to address this gap in TPDS delivery. Essentially, the scheme has been launched keeping in mind the internal migration of our country, since people keep moving to different states in search of better job opportunities and higher standards of living.

Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, claims that Huawei is working on in-folding foldable device, similar to the Galaxy Fold, instead of its previously released outward-folding phones like the Huawei Mate X and Huawei Mate Xs. Young claims that this device will be aggressively priced, which would be welcome, given that its previous foldable phone models were both priced above EUR 2,000.Young, in an  with GregglesTV on YouTube revealed a few details about Huawei's foldable phone plans this year. He noted that the company is looking to bring both clamshell and in-folding designs to the market. It may launch the in-folding model as soon as September or October of 2020, and price it aggressively for wider reach.In the video, Young elaborated, \u201cWe think that a lot of companies are looking at Samsung's strategy for the clamshell (design) for the more aggressively priced version of a foldable and then the in-folding version for a more expensive and tablet-like experience. We expect to see Huawei pursue both the clamshell and in-folding models, and we think they're struggling to come up with an ultra-thin glass solution right now for the clamshell. But we do expect them to do an in-folding model later this year, and be pretty aggressively priced.\u201d Young also said that the company has ordered over 500,000 display units according to his supply chain sources.Samsung is also  on the Galaxy Fold 2, and the company is expected to launch it alongside the Galaxy Note 20 series sometime in August. Huawei could also launch this in-folding phone model alongside its next-gen Mate series, as that is when Huawei traditionally releases the flagship series. Samsung introduced the  in February with a clamshell-like foldable design, and Huawei looks to introduce a new foldable phone with the same design, according to Young. However, the in-folding phone will release first, and the clamshell variant should be launched after that, after Huawei finds a solution for the ultra-thin glass."},

The newly discovered planet, though heavier than our Earth, is one of those few planetary bodies that are similar to the Earth in terms of size and orbit. The planet's parent star has roughly 1/10th the mass of our Sun. The mass of the planet itself is nearly half the mass of Earth and Neptune combined, according to the researchers. The distance of the planet from its star is roughly equal to the distance between our Sun and a point between Venus and Earth.Researchers at the University of Canterbury (UC) were part of a team that collaborated for the discovery and found the new planet. Lead researchers in the , Dr Antonio Herrera Martin and Associate Professor Michael Albrow from the University of Canterbury's School of Physical and Chemical Sciences in the College of Science, collaborated with an international team for this investigation. The research paper was  in The Astronomical Journal.The paper's lead author, Dr Herrera Martin, while mentioning that the discovery was extremely rare, mentioned on the University website, \u201cTo have an idea of the rarity of the detection, the time it took to observe the magnification due to the host star was approximately five days, while the planet was detected only during a small five-hour distortion. After confirming this was indeed caused by another \u2018body' different from the star, and not an instrumental error, we proceeded to obtain the characteristics of the star-planet system\u201dNot many planets like this one have been discovered so far with the size and orbit similar to that of our Earth. This planet completes one revolution around its parent star in about 617 days. The researchers discovered the planet using a technique called gravitational microlensing.Dr Herrera Martin explained the technique. He told the University website, \u201cThe combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect.\u201dThe astronomers mentioned that microlensing effect is rare because only about one in a million stars in the galaxy get affected by the effect at a particular time. They also said that these observations do not repeat and catching a planet at the time of the effect has a very low probability.For this observation, the researchers used three identical telescopes in Chile, Australia, and South Africa. Most of these events happened due to single stars. However, Dr Herrera Martin noticed that there was an unusual shape to the light output from this event. After months of analysis, they concluded that the event happened due to a star with a low-mass planet."},
